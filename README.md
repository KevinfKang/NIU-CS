Programming Assignments, for reference only

The purpose of this repository is to be used as a reference. This code should definitely not be copied for assignments, certain elements and techniques may be used but straight copy-paste is not acceptable. It's better to learn and be able to do it yourself!

I hope this helps you improve your coding and if you have tips for me I'm open as well!
